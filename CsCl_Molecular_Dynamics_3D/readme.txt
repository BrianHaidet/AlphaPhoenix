Don't copy this straight into homework or something ridiculous - I'm
posting this so people can hopefully learn from it! It's not the cleanest
code, but I added a few more comments in the areas that need
explaining. and deleted all the extra bits of commented-out code that had
built up. Feel free to ask more questions on youtube here!

Skim through the program before running - it will automatically start
saving frame files and backup runtime files when you start the program,
so be ready for that (actually it'll probably glitch out if you don't have
the folders already, but still). It also needs "plotter.m' or
"plotterFast.m" in the same MATLAB path folder to read said frame files 
and output pictures.
